NOT UP TO DATE

# IntroductionToRobotics
This repo is used as an example for the Introduction to Robotics course, held at Universty of Bucharest in the academic year 2019 - 2020.

The idea is to find in the student's repo all the resources and the projects he or she has been working on. For now, it is required to have one Laboratory_Homeworks folder, in which you will find the homeworks after each lab. Later, when we get to the projects, we'll create a folder for each of them.
